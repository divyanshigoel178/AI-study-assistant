Unit – 4 Resource Management & Security
In Cloud

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🌐 Resource Management in Cloud
In cloud, resources = CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth, applications.
Resource management means distributing, controlling, and monitoring these resources so
every user gets what they need without waste.
Example: If 100 students use Google Drive at the same time, Google must manage its storage
servers so that everyone gets smooth service.
🔗 Inter-Cloud Resource Management
• Inter-cloud = between multiple cloud providers.
• Companies don’t always depend on just one cloud (like AWS). They may use AWS + Azure +
Google Cloud together.
• Inter-cloud resource management = managing and sharing resources across different cloud
providers.
👉 Example:
Netflix uses AWS for storage + Google Cloud for analytics.
They must manage resources across both to keep services running smoothly.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
❖ Why is it Needed? (Need for Inter-Cloud Resource Management)
1. High Demand Handling 📈
If one cloud runs out of resources, another cloud can provide them.
2. Cost Optimization 💰
Different clouds have different prices. Companies choose the cheapest option for a resource.
3. Better Performance ⚡
User gets service from the nearest cloud server for faster speed.
4. Avoid Vendor Lock-in A
Companies don’t depend only on one provider; they can switch easily.
5. Business Continuity 🔄
If AWS has downtime, resources from Azure or Google Cloud can be used → no service
interruption.
6. Flexibility & Scalability 📦
Easy to increase/decrease resources using multiple clouds.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
Benefits of Inter-Cloud Resource Management ✅
1. Reliability
Even if one cloud fails, others keep the system running.
2. Cost Savings
Choose best price cloud provider at any time.
3. Global Access
Resources can be served from the nearest location worldwide.
4. Improved Security
Data can be divided across clouds (multi-cloud security).
5. Efficient Resource Usage
No wastage, resources are balanced across providers.
🌟 Simple Analogy
Think of Inter-cloud resource management like using multiple food delivery apps (Swiggy +
Zomato + UberEats):
Follow Us
RRSIMT CLASSES WHATSAPP - 9795358008
If Swiggy has no restaurant open, you can order from Zomato.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
☁️ Types of Inter-Cloud Resource Management
There are 2 main types:
1. 🌐 Federation Clouds
In federation cloud, many cloud providers agree to work together.
They share their resources (storage, computing, bandwidth) voluntarily.
It’s like a teamwork of cloud providers.
👉 Example:
• Suppose Govt. of India has its own private cloud.
• It can join with another state government’s cloud → so both can share resources (data,
apps, storage).
• Universities and research centers also use federated clouds to share computing power.
✅ Key points of Federation Cloud:
• Cloud providers cooperate.
• Resources are openly exchanged.
• Used by governments, NGOs, universities, private clouds.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
2. ☁️ Multi-Cloud
In multi-cloud, one company or client uses many different clouds (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud,
etc).
But here, cloud providers do not cooperate with each other.
The client (user) must manage resources between them.
👉 Example:
▪ Netflix uses AWS for video streaming + Google Cloud for analytics + Azure for AI.
▪ But AWS and Google are not “working together”; Netflix itself manages resources.
✅ Key points of Multi-Cloud:
• Providers do not share resources voluntarily.
• User (or their software tools) decides how to use different clouds.
• Mix of public + private clouds often.
• Popular for flexibility, backup, and cost savings.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🌐 Topologies in Inter-Cloud Architecture(How Inter Cloud Arch. Works)
There are 4 main types:
1. Peer-to-Peer Inter-Cloud Federation
• Clouds connect directly with each other.
• They negotiate and share resources without any middleman.
• Sometimes, they use a small directory/broker just to find other clouds, but most work is
direct communication.
👉 Example:
Two universities (University A & University B) connect their
private clouds directly to share computing resources for
Auditor
research.
RESERVOIR Project is based on this.
✅ Key Idea: Direct cloud-to-cloud friendship.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
2. 🏢 Centralized Inter-Cloud Federation
• A central authority controls and manages resource sharing.
• This central body keeps a registry (database) of available resources from all clouds.
• When a cloud needs resources, it asks the central manager.
👉 Example:
Think of a job portal like Naukri.com. Companies (clouds) post jobs (resources), and students
(clouds in need) apply through the central website.
Projects like Dynamic Cloud Collaboration (DCC)
and Federated Cloud Management use this.
✅ Key Idea: One central manager coordinates
everything.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
3. ☁️ Multi-Cloud Service
• Here, a client uses a service that gives access to multiple clouds.
• A broker service helps the client choose and manage resources from different clouds.
👉 Example:
A travel booking site (like MakeMyTrip) checks flights from IndiGo, Air India, Vistara at once
→ you don’t go to each airline’s site.
Similarly, a multi-cloud service helps you use AWS,
Azure, and Google Cloud together.
Examples: OPTIMUS, Contrail, MOSAIC, STRATOS.
✅ Key Idea: A broker service helps clients connect
to many clouds.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
4. 📚 Multi-Cloud Libraries
Instead of using an external broker, the client builds its own broker using libraries (APIs).
Libraries give a common way (standard API) to access different clouds.
Developers write code once and use it with any cloud.
👉 Example:
If you are coding in Java/Python/Ruby, you can use
special libraries like:
• JClouds (Java)
• Apache LibCloud (Python)
• Apache DeltaCloud (Ruby)
These libraries help you connect to AWS, Azure,
Google Cloud in the same way.
✅ Key Idea: Client uses APIs/libraries to make
cloud usage simple and uniform.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🌟 Super Simple Analogy
❖ Peer-to-Peer → Like two friends sharing books directly ☎.
❖ Centralized → Like a library 📚 where all books are registered, and you borrow through the
librarian.
❖ Multi-Cloud Service → Like a travel app 🛫 showing flights from many airlines.
❖ Multi-Cloud Libraries → Like having a universal charger 🔌 that works with any phone
brand.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🌐 Resource Provisioning in Cloud :
• Provisioning = assigning and managing resources (CPU, storage, memory, network, apps) to
cloud users when they need it.
• It’s like giving resources on demand.
👉 Example:
When you create a new Gmail account, Google provisions storage (15GB) for you.
When you buy Netflix subscription, it provisions servers & bandwidth to stream videos for you.
So provisioning = making resources ready and available.
🛠Types of Resource Provisioning
There are 3 main types:
1. Static Provisioning
2. Dynamic Provisioning
3. Self service provisionig

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
1. Static Provisioning
• Resources are fixed and given in advance.
• Even if the user does not use them fully, they cannot change.
• No automatic scaling (increase/decrease).
👉 Example:
A company buys 5 servers permanently from a cloud provider. Even if it uses only 2 servers,
it still pays for all 5.
Like buying a fixed-size water tank 🚰 – whether you use it or not, it’s always there.
✅ Good for: Workloads that are predictable and stable (e.g., small websites).
2. ⚡ Dynamic Provisioning
• Resources are allocated automatically based on demand.
• If demand increases → more resources are added.
• If demand decreases → resources are reduced.
• This saves money and improves efficiency.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
👉 Example:
Amazon shopping website adds extra servers on Black Friday sale and reduces them later.
Like a water tap connected to a pipeline 🚰 – water (resources) increases or decreases as you
need.
✅ Good for: Workloads that change frequently (e.g., e-commerce sites, video streaming).
3. Self-Service Provisioning
• Users can create, manage, and delete resources themselves without asking the cloud
provider.
• A dashboard or portal is provided where users can choose what they need.
👉 Example:
On AWS or Azure, you can log in, choose a virtual machine, storage, or database, and create it
instantly.
Like online shopping 🛒 – you select what you want, pay, and it’s delivered immediately.
Good for: Developers, companies, and anyone who wants full control and flexibility.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🔑 Analogy to Remember
✓ Static = Prepaid SIM card 📱 (you buy fixed data
✓ in advance, whether you use or not).
✓ Dynamic = Postpaid SIM card 📱 (you pay
✓ according to how much you use).
✓ Self-Service = Recharge app 💳 (you can
✓ recharge or change plan anytime yourself).

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🌐 Demand-Driven vs Event-Driven Resource Provisioning
Both are types of Dynamic Provisioning (where resources increase or decrease
automatically).
1. 📈 Demand-Driven Resource Provisioning
• Resources are added or removed based on user demand (workload).
• The system looks at how many users are active or how much load is on servers.
• If demand increases → more resources are given.
• If demand decreases → extra resources are removed.
👉 Example:
Amazon website adds more servers during Black Friday sales when many users visit.
YouTube adds extra bandwidth when too many people watch videos at the same time.
✅ Easy Analogy:
Like a restaurant hiring extra chefs when more customers come, and letting them go
when business is slow.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
2. ⚡ Event-Driven Resource Provisioning
• Resources are added or removed based on specific events or triggers, not just demand.
• An “event” can be: system error, sudden traffic spike, new user sign-up, scheduled job, or an
attack.
• System reacts immediately when the event occurs.
👉 Example:
A news website automatically adds servers when breaking news is published (event = news
release).
A company’s backup server turns on when main server crashes (event = failure).
Auto-scaling triggers if CPU usage goes beyond 80% (event = CPU threshold crossed).
✅ Easy Analogy:
Like fire alarms 🚨 — they trigger instantly when smoke (event) is detected, and fire sprinklers
turn on.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
❖ What is a Global Cloud Exchange?
A Global Cloud Exchange is like a big market or stock-exchange — but for cloud resources
(CPU, storage, bandwidth, special services).
• Cloud providers offer spare resources.
• Customers or other clouds buy/borrow those resources when they need them.
• A central system (an exchange or brokers) helps find, match, negotiate and settle deals
between providers and consumers.
Analogy: imagine an electricity market where power plants sell extra power and shops buy it
when demand is high. The cloud exchange does the same for computing power, storage, and
network.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
❖ Why do we need a Global Cloud Exchange?
1. Handle Peaks & Bursts – If your website suddenly gets millions of visitors, you can take
extra capacity from the market immediately.
2. Cost Optimization – Pick the cheapest provider for a specific time or region.
3. Better Performance / Locality – Serve users from a nearby datacenter (lower latency).
4. Failover & Resilience – If one cloud fails, others can take over quickly.
5. Access to Specialized Services – Get a special GPU farm, or a region-specific service,
without buying it yourself.
6. Avoid Vendor Lock-in – You can move between providers easily because resources are
traded.
7. Global Resource Pooling – Small clouds or universities can share resources with others to
run big jobs.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🔁 How Global Cloud Exchange Works :
1. Provider Registers Resources
• Cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or smaller clouds) tell the exchange:
• What resources they have (CPU, storage, servers, network).
• Location (India, US, Europe).
• Price and capacity.
• SLA (Service Level Agreement = performance promises like 99.9% uptime).
👉 Example: AWS says: “I have 100 servers available in Mumbai at $0.05/hour each, with
99.9% uptime.”
2. Consumer (or Broker) Requests Resources
A company (consumer) or a broker (middleman) goes to the exchange and requests
resources.
They specify:
• What they need (like 20 CPUs, 500GB storage).
• How long (time window → 1 day, 1 week).

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
• Quality of Service (QoS → like speed, latency).
👉 Example: Flipkart asks: “I need 20 servers in India for 5 days with fast response under
50ms.”
3. Matchmaking (Finding the Best Provider)
• The exchange compares consumer’s request with providers’ offers.
• It finds the best match (correct location, price, speed, capacity).
👉 Example: The exchange checks AWS, Azure, and Google, and finds AWS Mumbai fits
Flipkart’s needs.
4. SLA Negotiation (Agreement on Service Level)
• Both sides agree on terms:
• Uptime (99.9% or 99.99%).
• Latency (how fast service responds).
• Price and penalties if SLA breaks.
👉 Example: Flipkart and AWS agree: “If uptime goes below 99.9%, AWS w ill give a refund.”

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
5. Provisioning & Orchestration
The resources are now allocated and set up for the consumer.
Orchestration = connecting everything together (servers, storage, network).
👉 Example: Flipkart’s new 20 servers are launched automatically and connected to their
website system.
6. Monitoring
The exchange keeps checking whether the provider is following SLA (uptime, speed,
availability).
If something goes wrong → alerts are sent.
👉 Example: Exchange monitors AWS servers to ensure Flipkart’s website stays online and
fast.
7. Billing & Settlement
At the end, usage is measured (metering).
Bills are created and payments are settled.
👉 Example: Flipkart used 20 servers for 5 days = 20 × 24 × $0.05 = $24.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🌟 Super Simple Analogy
Think of it like Uber for Cloud 🚕:
➢ Drivers (providers) register cars (resources).
➢ Rider (consumer) requests a ride (resources).
➢ Uber app (exchange) matches rider and driver.
➢ They agree on fare (SLA negotiation).
➢ Ride happens (provisioning).
➢ Uber tracks the ride (monitoring).
➢ At the end, payment is made (billing).

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
⚠️ Challenges in Global Cloud Exchange
1. Interoperability (Compatibility Issue)
• Different clouds (AWS, Azure, Google) use different systems and APIs.
• Hard to connect or move apps between them.
👉 Example: An app built for AWS may not run easily on Azure.
2. Security & Trust
When you use another provider’s resources, you must trust them with your data.
👉 Example: What if they don’t encrypt your files properly? Or misuse your data?
3. Data Privacy & Laws
Many countries have rules: data must stay inside the country.
👉 Example: Indian user data may not be allowed to move to US servers.
4. SLA (Service Level Agreement) Issues
If provider promises 99.9% uptime but fails, who takes responsibility?
👉 Example: If Flipkart’s site crashes, who pays — AWS or the exchange?

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
☁️ Cloud Security Overview :
Cloud security means protecting data, applications, and resources that are stored and used
in the cloud.
It makes sure:
✅ Confidentiality – Only the right people can access the data.
✅ Integrity – Data cannot be changed by attackers.
✅ Availability – Cloud services must be available all the time (no downtime).
👉 Example: Just like you lock your house with keys, CCTV, and security guard — in the cloud,
we use encryption, firewalls, and monitoring.
⚠️ Security Challenges in Cloud Computing :
1. Data Breach (Data Theft)
Hackers may steal sensitive data from cloud.
👉 Example: Credit card info stolen from a shopping site’s cloud.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
2. Data Loss
Data may get deleted accidentally or due to attack.
👉 Example: A company loses customer records because backup failed.
3. Account Hijacking
If hackers steal login/password, they can control cloud resources.
👉 Example: Hacker logs into AWS account and uses it to mine cryptocurrency.
4. Insider Threats
Employees of cloud provider or company misuse access.
👉 Example: A staff member copies secret project files.
5. Insecure APIs
Cloud provides APIs (software interfaces). If APIs are weak, hackers can attack easily.
👉 Example: Poorly protected API lets hacker access user database.
6. Compliance & Legal Issues
Different countries have different rules about data storage.
👉 Example: EU’s GDPR law says data of Europeans must stay safe inside EU.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
7. Shared Technology Risks
In cloud, many users share the same hardware. If isolation fails, data can leak.
👉 Example: One company’s data becomes visible to another due to a bug.
8. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Attackers overload the cloud system so it crashes.
👉 Example: Flooding Flipkart’s website with fake traffic so real customers can’t shop.
🔐 Security Governance in Cloud Computing
Security Governance = A set of rules, policies, and controls that guide how security is managed
in the cloud.
👉 It ensures cloud services are safe, legal, and aligned with business goals.
🛡Key Parts of Cloud Security Governance
1. Policies & Rules
Define what is allowed and what is not.
👉 Example: “All data must be encrypted” or “Only managers can access financial reports.”

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
2. Roles & Responsibilities
Clear assignment of who manages what (cloud provider vs customer).
👉 Example: Provider secures the hardware; customer secures passwords.
3. Compliance & Regulations
Follow laws (like GDPR, HIPAA, IT Act in India).
👉 Example: A hospital must protect patient data according to medical laws.
4. Risk Management
Identify possible risks (data loss, hacking) and prepare solutions.
👉 Example: Backup plans in case of server crash.
5. Monitoring & Auditing
Keep checking the system to make sure rules are followed.
👉 Example: Regular security scans, log reviews, audits.
6. Incident Response
Define steps if something goes wrong (attack or data leak).
👉 Example: If hacker attacks, system should lock accounts and notify admin.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
☁️ SaaS(Software as a service) Security :
SaaS = Software delivered over the internet (like Gmail, Google Drive, Zoom, Dropbox).
SaaS Security = Protecting data, users, and applications inside SaaS platforms from theft, loss,
or misuse.
👉 Example: Keeping your Google Drive safe from hackers or unauthorized users.
🌟 Importance of SaaS Security
1. Protects sensitive data
👉 Example: A company’s financial reports on Google Drive must stay private.
2. Ensures business continuity
👉 If SaaS is attacked, business apps (like Zoom or Salesforce) can stop working.
3. Compliance with laws
👉 Companies must follow legal rules like GDPR (Europe) or HIPAA (healthcare).
4. Builds trust
👉 Customers feel safe when they know their data is secure.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
⚠️ Key Challenges in SaaS Security
1. Data Breaches
Hackers may steal company or personal data.
👉 Example: Hackers stealing emails from Gmail.
2. Account Hijacking
Weak or stolen passwords let attackers take over accounts.
👉 Example: Someone steals your Netflix account login.
3. Insider Threats
Employees (inside company or SaaS provider) may misuse access.
👉 Example: A worker downloads confidential files without permission.
4. Shadow IT
Employees use SaaS apps without IT approval.
👉 Example: Staff storing work files on personal Dropbox.
5. Data Loss / Lack of Backup
If SaaS fails or is deleted, data may be lost.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
👉 Example: Accidentally deleting important files from Google Docs.
6. Compliance Issues
SaaS data stored in other countries may break legal rules.
👉 Example: A company storing Indian data on US servers against law.
🛡SaaS Security Best Practices
1. Strong Authentication
Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) → password + OTP or fingerprint.
2. Data Encryption
Encrypt data at rest (stored) and in transit (moving over internet).
3. Access Control
Give users only necessary access (least privilege).
👉 Example: Interns can’t access financial records.
4. Regular Monitoring & Auditing
Track logins, unusual activity, and generate security reports.
5. Backup & Recovery Plans

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
Keep regular backups in case of accidental deletion or attack.
6. Employee Training
Teach employees to avoid phishing, weak passwords, and unsafe apps.
7. Compliance Checks
Ensure SaaS providers follow rules like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
☁️ What is Virtualized Security?
Virtualized Security = Security designed for virtual environments (where many virtual
machines run on the same physical server using a hypervisor).
👉 In simple words:
When one computer (server) is divided into many virtual machines (VMs), normal security
tools (like firewalls, antivirus) may not work properly.
So, virtualized security provides special protection for these VMs, hypervisors, and virtual
networks.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
⚙️ How Virtualized Security Works?
1. Monitors Virtual Machines (VMs): Keeps an eye on each VM to prevent attacks.
2. Protects Hypervisor: Secures the software (hypervisor) that controls all VMs.
3. Isolates Resources: Stops one VM from accessing or attacking another VM.
4. Virtual Firewalls & IDS/IPS: Creates security tools inside the virtual environment (not only on
physical hardware).
👉 Example: Imagine one big apartment building 🏢 (server) with many flats (VMs). Virtualized
security = CCTV, locks, and guards inside the building to keep each flat safe.
🛡Types of Virtualization Security :
1. Network Virtualization Security -
• Protects virtual networks (software-based networks inside the cloud).
• Uses virtual firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection systems (IDS).
👉 Example: Just like Wi-Fi password protects your home network, network virtualization
security protects data moving between VMs.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
2. Storage Virtualization Security
Protects data stored in virtualized storage systems (like SAN, cloud storage).
Uses encryption, access control, backup.
👉 Example: Like locking your cupboard (encryption) so only you can open it, even if it’s
inside a shared room.
3. Server Virtualization Security
Protects virtual machines (VMs) running on a server.
Uses antivirus, VM isolation, snapshots for recovery.
👉 Example: If one flat in an apartment catches fire, walls (isolation) stop it from spreading to
other flats.
4. Application Virtualization Security
• Protects apps running in a virtual environment.
• Uses sandboxing (isolating apps), patching, access control.
👉 Example: Running a risky app inside a “sandbox” so even if it has a virus, it cannot
damage other apps.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
☁️ What is Cloud IAM?
Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) = A system that controls who can access cloud
resources, what they can do, and under what conditions.
👉 Example: In Google Drive, you can decide:
• Arman = can view only
• Abhishek = can edit files
• Admin = can add/remove users
That’s Cloud IAM in action.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🔑 Key Components of Cloud IAM
1. Identities (Users & Groups)
People or services using the cloud.
👉 Example: Employee, Admin, Application.
2. Authentication
Verifying “Who are you?”.
👉 Example: Logging in with password, OTP, or fingerprint.
3. Authorization (Access Control)
Deciding “What can you do?”.
👉 Example: View file, edit file, delete file.
4. Roles & Policies
Define permissions clearly.
👉 Example:
Viewer = Read-only.
Editor = Read + Write.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
Admin = Full control.
5. Audit & Monitoring
Track who accessed what and when.
👉 Example: Log showing “Ali downloaded report at 5PM.”
🌟 Benefits of Cloud IAM
1. Stronger Security 🔐
Prevents unauthorized access.
2. Least Privilege 👤
Users get only what they need, nothing extra.
3. Compliance 📜
Meets legal rules (like GDPR, HIPAA).
4. Centralized Control 🖥
One dashboard to manage access across all cloud services.
5. Scalability 📈
Easy to add/remove thousands of users in large companies.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🛡Best Practices for Cloud IAM
1. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
👉 Password + OTP = more security.
2. Follow Least Privilege Principle
👉 Give only minimum access required.
3. Regularly Review Access
👉 Remove access for employees who leave.
4. Strong Password Policies
👉 Force users to set strong, unique passwords.
5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
👉 Assign roles (Admin, User, Viewer) instead of manual permissions.
6. Enable Logging & Monitoring
👉 Keep track of suspicious activity.
7. Use Identity Federation
👉 Allow login with trusted IDs (like Google, Microsoft).

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
☁️ What is Cloud Security Standard?
• Cloud Security Standards = Rules and guidelines made by international organizations to
ensure cloud systems are safe, reliable, and compliant.
👉 Example: Just like food safety standards (FSSAI, FDA) ensure food is safe to eat, cloud
security standards ensure data in the cloud is safe to store and process.
🌟 Why Cloud Security Standards are Needed?
o To protect data from theft or loss.
o To meet government regulations (laws).
o To build trust between cloud providers and users.
o To ensure all providers follow the same security practices.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🔑 Common Cloud Security Standards (Easy)
1. ISO/IEC 27001 & 27017 & 27018
a) ISO/IEC 27001 → Standard for Information Security Management.
👉 Example: Ensures cloud provider has strong security controls.
b) ISO/IEC 27017 → Focuses on cloud-specific security guidelines.
👉 Example: Rules for VM isolation, cloud firewalls.
c) ISO/IEC 27018 → Protects personal data in cloud.
👉 Example: Ensures user privacy in Google Drive/OneDrive.
2. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
US-based standard with a Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).
Defines Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover steps.
👉 Example: Cloud provider must have monitoring, backups, and recovery plans.
3. CSA STAR (Cloud Security Alliance – Security Trust Assurance and Risk)
A program that rates cloud providers’ security practices.
👉 Example: Like a “security certificate” that shows AWS/Azure/Google fo llow best practices.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
4. PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
Standard for protecting payment and cardholder data in the cloud.
👉 Example: PayPal or Stripe must follow PCI DSS to protect credit card numbers.
5. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
US standard for healthcare data security.
👉 Example: Cloud apps storing hospital patient records must follow HIPAA.
6. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation – EU Law)
Protects personal data of European citizens.
👉 Example: A cloud provider must ask permission before storing your data and allow you to
delete it (“Right to be Forgotten”).
7. FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)
US government cloud security standard.
👉 Example: If a cloud provider wants to provide services to the US govt, it must be FedRAMP
certified.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
🍯 What is a Honeypot?
A honeypot is a fake system, server, or resource created to attract hackers and study their
activities.
👉 Example: Like putting a jar of honey 🍯 in the forest to attract bees — in cybersecurity,
we put a fake target to attract hackers.
It looks real but it’s actually a trap.
🔑 Types of Honeypots
1. Low-Interaction Honeypot
Simulates only basic services (like fake login page, fake database).
Easy to set up, less risky.
👉 Example: A fake email server that just records login attempts.
2. High-Interaction Honeypot
A real system with operating system & applications, but isolated.
Lets attackers spend more time → gives deep insights.
👉 Example: A real Windows server left vulnerable to watch how hackers attack.

Cloud Computing (BCS071/BCS713)
3. Production Honeypot
Placed inside real company network.
Used mainly for detection and diversion (not for research).
👉 Example: A fake database inside a bank’s cloud to distract hackers.
4. Research Honeypot
Used by security researchers to study hacker behavior.
Collects data about attack patterns, tools, and malware.
👉 Example: A university runs a fake network to learn about new viruses.
5. Malware Honeypot
Special honeypot designed to trap malware (viruses, worms, ransomware).
👉 Example: A fake Android app store used to catch malware apps.
6. Spam Honeypot
Designed to trap spammers.
Creates fake email accounts to collect spam messages.
👉 Example: A system that records spammers sending junk mail.
